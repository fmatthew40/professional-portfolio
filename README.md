#Professional Portfolio Webpage

#Description: My professional portfolio is a webpage-based portfolio. It contains a picture of me, an about me section, a resume link, and links to my completed projects.
I used HTML and CSS for this project. I used shadowing effects and hover effects as part of my CSS styling. "Coming Soon" pictures that I used were from unsplash.com. Permission was not needed to use these photos.
