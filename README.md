#Professional Portfolio Webpage

#Description:
My professional portfolio is a webpage-based portfolio.  It contains a picture of me, an about me section, a resume link, and links to my completed projects.  
I used HTML and CSS for this project.  I used shadowing effects and hover effects as part of my CSS styling.  "Coming Soon" pictures that I used were from unsplash.com.  Permission was not needed to use these photos.
