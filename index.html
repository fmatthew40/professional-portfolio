                <p> I'm Matthew Foster and I am currently working to learn all I can about coding.  I have experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  I am currently enrolled in a Coding Bootcamp through University of Arizona.  Once I complete this bootcamp, I will have a plethora of knowledge in coding concepts and programs.  At that time, I will be actively looking to change to a career in the coding field. <br> I currently hold a bachelor's degree in business finance.  I also hold a master's degree in Eduction with an emphasis in "English as a Second Language".  <br> I have been a fifth grade teacher for 9 years.  During that time, I worked my way up a position in leadership.  I was part of our school's leadership committee, which was responsible for making major decisions that affected the school.  <br> With my experience in leadership and coding, I feel I will one day make a great full stack developer and will be an asset to any team.    </p>
